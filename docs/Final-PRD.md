# OmniPanel LLM Workspace — Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 🧠 Background

### Problem Statement
- **Fragmented LLM UX:** Existing local LLM tools like WebUI and LM Studio have outdated, non-extensible UIs, lacking real "project/workspace" structure, code and notebook workflows, modern file management, and developer/data science features.
- **Siloed Apps:** No single platform brings together chat, code, data science, and automation with seamless experience across web, desktop, and mobile.
- **Growing Need for Privacy, Extensibility, and Productivity:** Tech teams, developers, and solo builders want powerful, private, extensible AI workspaces that work both offline and online and support a broad range of LLMs.
- **Developer Pain:** Current solutions require complex setups, lack instant onboarding, and have poor model switching, plugin ecosystems, or real-time sync.

### Market Opportunity
- **Demand for Local/Hybrid AI:** Surge in interest for local, private, and hybrid LLMs due to cost, privacy, and speed.
- **Lack of Real Developer and Data Science Workflow:** Most competitors focus on simple chat or code gen, not full-featured IDE/data science workflows.
- **OmniPanel's Edge:** Notion + VSCode + Jupyter + ChatGPT + Terminal for any LLM (local or cloud), in a unified, extensible, beautifully designed workspace, cross-platform.
- **Broad User Base:** Developers, data scientists, tech leads, educators, students, enterprise IT, and AI hobbyists.

### User Personas
- **Developers:** Need seamless chat, code, and file/project management with advanced features (file tree, terminal, plugins, Git).
- **Data Scientists:** Require notebooks, data visualization, reproducibility, and integration with local/cloud LLMs.
- **Tech Leads/Teams:** Value secure, multi-user, collaborative workspaces deployable on-prem or self-hosted cloud.
- **Solo Builders/Power Users:** Demand instant onboarding, model flexibility, rapid prototyping, and extensibility.
- **Educators/Students:** Seek easy install, rich documentation, interactive demos, and project templates.

### Vision Statement
Deliver the industry's most modern, extensible, and enjoyable LLM workspace—combining project-based chat, code, notebooks, and automation, accessible from desktop, mobile, and web, with a best-in-class plugin ecosystem and broad LLM/model support.

### Product Origin
OmniPanel arose from developer/data scientist frustration with piecemeal tools and UX. Confirmed via user research and competitive analysis, it evolved from a chat UI to a "super-app" for AI productivity, inspired by VSCode, Notion, and Jupyter.

## 🎯 Objectives

### SMART Goals
- **Specific:** Ship a unified LLM workspace—Desktop, Web, Mobile, Docs, and Website—using shared code/packages, supporting every major LLM and workflow.
- **Measurable:** 10,000 MAU, <10s onboarding, <2s average response, 100+ plugin downloads/month in the first 6 months.
- **Achievable:** Build on proven tech (Next.js, Electron, React Native, NeonDB, Monaco, xterm.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion).
- **Relevant:** Addresses growing market for local/private/hybrid AI tools and real developer/data science workflows.
- **Time-bound:** MVP for all platforms in 16 weeks; first public beta in 12 weeks.

### KPIs
- DAU/MAU by platform and cohort
- Session length, retention, and frequency
- Model connector usage (% by model)
- Plugin install rate, crash/error reports, user satisfaction/NPS
- Conversion from free to pro/enterprise

### Qualitative Objectives
- Users feel "at home" and productive immediately; zero-friction onboarding.
- Real-world "aha moments" (e.g., seamless file/project import, model switching, AI-powered code review).
- Developers praise extensibility, plugin SDK, and documentation.

### Strategic Alignment
- Grows a healthy OSS/community ecosystem around the core app and plugins.
- Creates a pipeline for pro/enterprise services (self-hosted, custom plugins, support).
- Showcases best-in-class developer tooling for LLM-powered workflows.

### Risk Mitigation
- Automated testing (unit, E2E), robust plugin sandboxing, permissioning.
- Real-time error reporting, rollback, and offline/online sync fallback.
- Extensive accessibility testing and security reviews.
