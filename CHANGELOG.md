### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### Layout Structure Enhancement
```typescript
// Clean flex layout hierarchy
Header (fixed height)
└── Content Container (flex row)
    ├── Sidebar (resizable, 200-500px)
    ├── File Tree (resizable, 200-600px) 
    └── Main Content (flex-1, remaining space)
```

#### Resize System Implementation
```typescript
const handleSidebarMouseDown = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  setIsResizingSidebar(true);
  const startX = e.clientX;
  const startWidth = sidebarWidth;
  
  const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    const newWidth = Math.max(200, Math.min(500, startWidth + (e.clientX - startX)));
    setSidebarWidth(newWidth);
  };
  
  // Proper cleanup implementation
};
```

#### CSS Optimization
```css
.workspace-sidebar {
  @apply flex-shrink-0 glass-dark border-r border-border;
  /* Removed conflicting position and z-index */
}

.file-tree-panel {
  @apply flex-shrink-0 bg-card border-r border-border;
  /* Clean positioning without conflicts */
}

.workspace-resizer {
  @apply absolute top-0 right-0 w-1 h-full cursor-col-resize hover:bg-primary/20 transition-colors;

- **Pattern Matching Resolution**: Discovered and fixed "unmatched function pattern" errors
- **Build Context Understanding**: Learned Vercel build directory context for proper pattern matching
- **Dual Configuration Management**: Maintained consistency between root and web app vercel.json files

### 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

#### Node.js Version Updates
```json
// BEFORE (inconsistent):
"engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }  // Root
"engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0" }  // Website

// AFTER (standardized):
"engines": { "node": ">=22.0.0", "pnpm": ">=8.0.0" }
```

#### Vercel Runtime Configuration Evolution
```json
// ITERATION 1 (invalid format):
"runtime": "nodejs22.x"

// ITERATION 2 (incorrect pattern):
"runtime": "@vercel/node@3.0.0"

// FINAL (working):
"runtime": "@vercel/node@5.2.2"
```

#### Function Pattern Resolution
```json
// BROKEN (absolute path):
"functions": {
  "apps/web/app/api/**/*.ts": {
    "runtime": "@vercel/node@5.2.2"
  }
}

// WORKING (relative to build context):
"functions": {
  "app/api/**/*.ts": {
    "runtime": "@vercel/node@5.2.2"
  }
}
```

### 🚨 Error Resolution Journey

#### Error 1: Invalid Runtime Format
```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```
**Solution**: Research revealed need for `@package@version` format

#### Error 2: Unmatched Function Pattern  
```
Error: The pattern "apps/web/app/api/**/*.ts" doesn't match any Serverless Functions.
```
**Solution**: Pattern must be relative to build output directory

#### Error 3: File Type Mismatch
**Solution**: Changed from `.js` to `.ts` to match TypeScript API routes
